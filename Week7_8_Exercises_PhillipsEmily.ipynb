      " 'When I was a kid, and lived in a Midwestern town of about 1100, Halloween was awe.some. I had 2 older sisters, and Mom would drop us off in town (we lived about a mile out) at dusk and tell us to meet at Grandma\\'s (in town) at a certain time. Then we were turnt loose. Sisters always caught up with their older friends, and I made the rounds with mine. The streets were filled with kids, and no cars were out because everyone was home to greet the trick-r-treaters, except the local hoods TP-ing houses or rolling metal trashcans down the hill from the railroad tracks until it crashed into a parked car. Kids probably age 8-12 or so absolutely ruled the night. I ended up with a grocery bag of goods, and on the way home we always stopped at our neighbor\\'s house, the widow Mrs. Strickler, who had been a teacher at the local high school until she retired in the 70s. She did not get many visitors, mostly people she knew and their kids, so she always had an amazing assortment: at least 2 full-size candy bars (Clark was a favorite) and *always* a caramel popcorn ball. Most years the elementary school hosted a Halloween Festival in the gymnasium, with a costume contest, ring toss, \"teacher jail\" (where you would pay a little money to put a teacher in a cardboard box painted to look like a jail cell, for 15 minutes or whatever), a haunted house in the locker room, and all proceeds went to I think the Lion\\'s Club. One year when i was very young, I went as a paper sack of groceries. I was small enough Mom could cut arm and leg holes, and it was held up by suspenders that broke so I had to hold the bottom all night. I was carrying myself! Then Mom put boxes of stuff in with me. Well, I did not do much Halloween stuff in high school, except horror movies. I was too old/cool for trick-r-treating and not really into partying or vandalism or whatever (at least not that night ell oh ell). Of course by the time got to college ... well those are stories for another time.'\n",
